\textbf{AI} and \textbf{blockchain} are two of the most important drivers of innovation today. Both are bringing about significant changes in all aspects of our lives and are expected to contribute trillions of dollars to the global economy. 
\\
The future has arrived, complete with self-driving cars and charming assistants who can schedule appointments on your behalf in natural conversations. Furthermore, the emergence of new content and economic sharing platforms will mean that users will no longer be forced to rely on “untrustworthy middlemen” such as Facebook. 
\\
So, what happens if we combine these two disruptive technologies? Following the introduction of each new tech, we will share our vision for their combined future.
\\
Blockchain can power decentralized marketplaces and coordination platforms for various components of AI, including data, algorithms, and computing power. These will foster the innovation and adoption of AI to an unprecedented level.
\\ Blockchain will also help AI’s decisions be more transparent, explainable, and trustworthy. As all data on blockchain is publicly available, AI is the key to providing users with confidentiality and privacy.
